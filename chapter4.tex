\chapter{Relative network centrality and structural Ricardian comparative advantage}
%%Rajski?s information indices
In this chapter, I analyze the association between structural RCA  and network centrality.
 The motivation is as follows.
First according to Ricardo model  I expect that a industry within a country with relative lower cost to produce and export more a good.
The eigenvector centrality  of a country is high in a industry network if it exports to destinations which are important exporters themselves.
 A higher centrality of a country corresponds to higher trade shares.
 Therefore, we hypothesize that there may be a link between both measures. \\
The literature propagation of shocks in network  \cite{acemoglu2012} showed that network centrality
%why do we care
%similarity of network centrality to predictions of micro Ricardo model.
% Lower realtive cost to produce a good, hence higher trade shares.
%Eigenvector centrality by definition relative higher if I export to more important exporting countries.
% Acemolgu et al showed for the input output structure of an economy that industries with a higher network centrality conriubte more to a countrys GDP.
%Further they highlighted that network centrality is related to micro shocks.
% If the ranking of relative cost advantage is similar to network centrality, the latter is a simpler measure.
Further, I analyze the robustness of the results to changes of the normalization and  changes of the sample.
\section{International trade network}
In the following I define the trade network as directed and weighted network.
 The definition is based on \textcite{jackson2010} and \textcite{de2010}. I proceed by first defining the binary directed trade network and next the weighted trade network.\par
I define for each industry $k$ a trade network of $N = 1, \dots , n$ exporting countries $i$  and $N$ importing countries $j$.
The countries in the network are the nodes.
Each edge $g_{i,j}^k $ represents a trade relationship between an exporting industry $k$ in country $i$ and importing country $j$.
Since the trade relationships in each trade network are not symmetric the trade network is a directed network.
 \par
Specifically, I define a trade relationship as positive exports from industry $k$ in country $i$ to country $j$.
Each edge is represented by $g_{i,j}^k$, which is equal to one if there are positive exports in industry $k$ in country $i$ to country $j$ and zero otherwise.
Thus,
$g_{i,j}^k = \begin{cases}
 1 \quad \text{if} \quad x_{i,j}^k \neq 0 \\
0 \quad \text{if} \quad x_{i,j}^k = 0 \end{cases} $
For each industry $k$ the edges $g_{i,j}^k$ are recorded in a symmetric matrix  $g^k$  of the dimensions $n \times n$.
Now, based on the notation I define the binary trade network for each industry $k$ as the tuple of nodes and trade relationships $\cG^k(N, g^k)$. \par
To extent the binary trade network to its weighted version, I define the
weight variable $W_{i,j}^k$ which records the value of exports from industry $k$  in country $i$ to country $j$.
The weight of an edge  is thus denoted as the value of the exports in the trade relationship.
Analog to the matrices of trade relationships for the binary trade networks, I define for each industry $k$ a matrix, which records the weight of each trade relationship.
  This matrix $W^k$ is denoted as weight matrix. %Further, it has the interpretation of recording  the equilibrium relations at


er interactions have taken place \parencite{de2010}. \par
Based on the notation the weighted trade network for each industry is combination of the binary trade network and the weight matrix  $ITN^k =( \cG^k(N, g^k),W^k)$.
 \section{Network centrality}
The outline of eigenvector network centrality is based on the textbook of \textcite{jackson2010}, who attributes the original mathematical exposition to \textcite{Bonacich77}.
I first describe eigenvector centrality for a binary trade network.
The concept extends without modifications to a directed weighted network  \parencite{jackson2010}.  \par
Intuitively, eigenvector centrality describes the idea that a node is more central if it is connected to other central nodes.
The centrality of the other nodes is in turn determined by the centrality of the nodes are they are connected to.
Mathematically, defining the eigenvector centrality $C^e_i (g^k)$ associated with the network $g^k$, the centrality of an actor is proportional to the centrality of the nodes it is connected to.
\[  \lambda C^e_i (g^k) = \sum_{j \neq i}  g^k_{i,j}C^e_{i,j}(g^k)  \]
, where $\lambda$ is a proportionality constant.
Restating the equation in matrix notation and solving it
\begin{align*}
 \lambda C^e (g^k) & =  g^k C^e (g^k) \\
( I  \lambda-g^k) C^e(g^k) & = 0
 \end{align*}
where $ \lambda$ is the corresponding eigenvalue to the eigenvector $C^e(g^k)$.
In general this equation has $n$ solutions, however it is a convention to use the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue.
An important property of the eigenvector is implied by the Perron-Frobenius theorem.
It states that for a non-negative column stochastic matrix
 \footnote{A column stochastic matrix is a matrix, where each column sum is equal to one.}, the right-hand eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue is positive
 and equivalently for a non-negative row stochastic matrix that the left hand  eignevector for the largest eigenvalue is positive.
Further, the theorem implies that if for some power the matrix $g^k$ is positive, than the largest eigenvalue is equal to one and all other eigenvalues are smaller.
 \par
Extending the eigenvector centrality concept to the weighted and directed trade network is straightforward.
Instead of computing the eigenvector for each adjacency matrix $g^k$, I calculate it for each weight matrix $W^k$.
Moreover, take advantage of the Peron-Frobenius Theorem I row-normalize the weight matrix, so that each cell is divided by the sum of exports of a country.
Each cell of the matrix thus records the share of exports of the country in the exporting industry across destinations. \par
In the steps I outlined to construct, I described the weighted out eigenvector centrality.
However, likewise one could instead of column normalize the weight matrix and obtain the left eigenvector, which is the in eigenvector centrality.
 \par
My analysis is based on the out eigenvector, due to the following consideration.
The out eigenvector centrality is computed for the row-normalized matrix, where each cell records the export shares.
A higher out centrality denotes that a country is exporting to countries with relative higher export shares.
On the other hand, the in-eigenvector a higher centrality would describe that a country is importing from countries with high shares of imports.
Therefore, I focus on the  out-eignevector centrality due to its similarity to the structural RCA.


%Moreover I highlighted in the introduction that the literature on shock propagation in networks, offers an interpretation of network centrality as a measure of ability to produce goods.  In the trade network I describe here, hence the network centrality describe the ability of an industry in a certain country.  \par The TiVA indicator as I described in section 2. describes the break down of domestic value-added sold across destinations
%Therefore for the network centrality I expect that industries, which are more central, contribute more to the value added sold across destinations. Further, if my interpretation of network centrality is correct, it should be the case that the relative centrality may be interpreted as measure of the relative ability to of an industry in some country to export relative to a benchmark industry and country. Therefore  I hypothesize that the ranking of relative centrality is similar to the ranking I obtain from the structural RCA measure.
\section{Network centrality and structural Ricardian comparative advantage}
In this subsection, I analyze the association between relative network centrality and  structural RCA based on domestic value added export.
I applied two normalizations to the eigenvector centrality as to the RCA before computing the association between them.
Firstly, I normalized  both measures to the grand mean, the mean across industries and the mean across countries.
Secondly, I normalized both measures relative to a benchmark country (the USA) and a benchmark industry (the food and beverages industry). \par
In the introduction I  outlined the similarity of out eigenvector centrality and the RCA.
Given the similarity, if structural RCA and network centrality show comparable results, the later may be preferred as a simpler measure.
% Network centrality by definition an industry is more central if the industry exports to relative more important central nodes.
%Moreover, according to the Ricardo model higher trade shares reflects a relative high productivity.
Additionally, the network shock propagation literature showed two aspects about network centrality,
Firstly, a industry with higher network centrality in the input-output network contributes relative more to the value-added.
 Moreover, it showed that network centrality is related to microshocks.
  \par
%In the introduction I hypothesized based on the network shock propagation literature,
%that interpret network centrality may be interpreted as a measure of ability of an industry.
%Moreover, the empirical heterogeneous firms literature found that firms with a higher ability to produce goods are more likely to export (\cite{bernard2007}, \cite{ottaviano}), which is in line with results of the theoretical heterogeneous firms literature  (\cite{bernard2003}, \cite{melitz}).
In the following I first describe Tthe left graph, which shows the association between network centrality and RCA according to the first normalization.
First interpreting the left graph I see that for most countries the association of the rankings are quite high.
This can be seen as the average of Spearman $/rho$ is  0.76 and Kendall's  $/tau$ is 0.58.
Both China and the USA have a high similarity between the rankings.
On the other hand Finland and Mexico show relative high dissimilarity between the rankings.
I obtain very strong results for India and Indonesia.
For India is that Spearmans $/rho$ and  Kendall's  $/tau$ are negative.
For Indonesia, the results show a low yet positive coefficients for both measures.
\par
The right graph shows overall a higher association between RCA and network centrality.
 This can be seen from the fact that the average of Spearman $/rho$ is  0.85 and Kendall's  $/tau$ is 0.71.
Like before the graph shows that India and Indonesia have the lowest similarity between both measures.
However, the strength of association for India is slightly increased so that the sign of the association is positive.
Both Finland and Mexico show a increased similarity in the graph.
Further, it is noteworthy that for Canada the strenght of both association is reduced, indicating that the
rankings differ more for Canada. \par
 Overall, the results suggest that the ranking of RCA and network centrality are similar for backward value-added exports.
  However, noteworthy for India and Indonesia I observed that both rankings are very different.
  Hence, future research should analyse the conection between RCA and network centrality from a theoretical perspective.

% \section{Robustness}
% In this section, I examine the robustness of the correlation between the structural RCA and relative network centrality.
% The  robustness test encompass computing the (rank) correlation for a different year 1995, and two different samples.
% The first sample covers the same countries as the extended sample used to estimate the fixed effects regression, except of the Rest of the world.
% Moreover, in both samples I changed the normalization such that the reference country is the USA and the reference industry is the food industry.
% %Moreover, I examine the time stability of the relative network centrality ranking.
% \par
% In the table \cref{tab:productivity_centrality_without_row} in column (2) and (3) the person and spearman correlation coefficients for the sample with rest of the world and in the columns (4)-(9) I report the deviation of the simple correlation or rank correlation from the coefficients in the columns (2) and (3). Moreover, I highlighted changes larger than 0.1 in grey.  \par First, the table confirms the robustness of the conclusion that the association between relative network centrality and the indicator of structural RCA  is stronger for the rank correlation than for the simple correlation. Moreover it confirms   that the relation between both is rather monotone than linear.  \par In addition, the change of the year shows overall an increased  simple correlation coefficients. The changes are heterogeneous showing both increased coefficients mostly for the service industry and some decreased coefficients in the manufacturing industries (ISIC 15-37). The largest increase is in the social service industry and for the construction industry. The largest decrease is reported for the wood industry. The rank correlation shows less changes in comparison. The largest increases are in the food industry and real estate industry. Overall the robustness check qualitatively leaves the conclusions unaltered. \par The change of the normalization and exclusion of ROW from the sample in the columns (6) to (7) shows  only minor effects for both correlations.  I record only one larger change for the simple correlation coefficient for the metal industry. The robustness check thus confirms the previous conclusions. \par In the last two columns I report the results of changing the sample to include only those countries, which were present in the estimation of the dispersion parameter. Eight industries have strong positive increased coefficients.  The industry with the largest increase is the communication industry. Four industries show small decreased coefficients. The industry with the largest decrease is  the wood industry.  Overall the simple correlation coefficients show a modest increase of about 0.09 or in relative terms of 13 \%. \par The rank correlation coefficients show for sixteen industries decreased coefficients. The largest decrease is in the gastronomy industry and in the social services industry.  Overall the decrease is on average 0.04 and is more modest  than the average increase of the simple correlation coefficients.  In the smaller sample the difference between the simple and rank correlation is half the size compared to the difference in the largest sample with ROW in 2005.\par  To conclude, all robustness test confirmed the previous results about the association between structural RCA and relative network centrality.
% %Overall the table \cref{tab:productivity_centrality_without_row}, confirms that the correlations between structural RCA and relative network centrality ranking is robust to changes in the reference country. The Pearson correlation shows the difference between column one and three of the absolute magnitude from -.07 to 0.13. The differences in the Pearson correlation are greater than the Spearman correlation. The differences in the Spearman correlations between column 2 and 4 are between 0.0 and 0.04, highlighting the robustness of the results.  %strange paragraph

%Further as a robustness test I report the correlations between structural RCA  and relative network centrality for the full sample and the sample including only countries, which were also present in the estimation sample. \par Overall the Spearman correlation coefficients show a slightly reduced correlation in the estimation sample compared to the full sample. The Pearson correlation results point in the opposite direction. They show mostly higher coefficients in the estimation sample. Therefore both correlations show more similar correlation coefficients in the estimation sample. \par The conclusion from the table \ref{tab:prod_cent} remain unaltered. The relation between both concepts is monotone rather than linear because the Spearman correlation coefficients are mostly higher than the Pearson correlation. Further, both concepts show a very high correlation.

%%Further I examine the time stability of relative network centrality between 1995 and 2005 in the table \ref{tab:rel_centr_95_05}.  For most sectors  I find that the table shows a strong or very strong correlation. The Pearson correlation coefficient spans between 0.51 and 0.97 \par

%In this section, I conducted several robustness checks to assess whether the high correlations for the revealed productivity based on different indicators and between revealed productivity and network centrality. Overall I conclude that the conclusions form the previous section are robust to the choice of the country coverage and changes in the normalization and the time. %Further examining the time stability I found that the  the ranking of network centrality shows in most industries a strong time stability.
